We endeavour to dispatch all in-stock orders within 1 working day, however we advise that you should allow 3-5 working days for delivery after you have ordered. After your order has been picked our service team will contact you with a suggested delivery date and approximate time and discuss any special requirements that you may have. We will generally call you on the day of your delivery to confirm all details. <br>

                 AGGTE® composite decking planks are heavy/bulky items and we advise anyone assisting in the unloading to wear suitable gloves and clothing. If the vehicle is invited on to the customer’s property it is entirely at the risk of the customer. NeoTimber and its delivery agents will not be liable for any damage to the property.<br>
